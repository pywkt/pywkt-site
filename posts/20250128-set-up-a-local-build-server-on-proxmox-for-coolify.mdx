In the last article we set up Coolify on an LXC in Proxmox and secured everything with Tailscale.

### Build Server

Create a new LXC in Proxmox
```text
General:
- Name: coolify-build
- Leave as "Unprivileged"
Template: 
- Debian 12
Disks: 
- 60GB
CPU: 
- 4 Cores
Memory: 
- 8GB (8192MiB)
Network: 
- DHCP
DNS: 
- Default
```

Before starting the LXC we need to log in to the root node and add the following to the config

```shell 
nano /etc/pve/lxc/<lxc-number>.conf
```

#### Add these lines to the bottom
```shell
lxc.cgroup.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net/tun dev/net/tun none bind,create=file
```

#### Save and exit.

Start the new `coolify-build` container

#### Update the system
```shell
apt update && apt upgrade
```

#### Install Curl
```shell
apt install curl
```

## Tailscale
Log in to Tailscale and get a new script for setting up Tailscale on a linux server

#### Paste the script in the new Build LXC

#### Start Tailscale with SSH
```shell
tailscale up --ssh
```

If you followed the [previous guide](20250127-deploy-to-vps-from-coolify-on-proxmox-lxc):
Go to the __Machines__ section in the Tailscale dashboard and add the __ACL Tag__ `coolify` to the __coolify-build__ node

## Build LXC

#### Create a directory on the build server to hold all the registry data
```shell
cd ~ && mkdir registry-data && cd registry-data
```

#### Create a docker-compose.yml file in the registry directory
```shell
touch docker-compose.yml
```

#### Add the following to the docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  registry:
    image: registry:2
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./registry-data:/var/lib/registry
      - ./auth:/auth
    environment:
      REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY: /var/lib/registry
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Save the `docker-compose.yml` file and create an `auth` directory in the __registry__ directory
```shell
mkdir auth
```

Still in the __registry__ directory, generate auth credentials
```shell
docker run --entrypoint htpasswd httpd:2 -Bbn <registry-username> <registry-password> > auth/htpasswd
```

Change `<registry-username>` and `<registry-password>` to unique values. We'll use these to log in later.

Change the permissions for the newly created `htpasswd` file
```shell
chmod 644 auth/htpasswd
```

Add the following to the __environment__ section of the `docker-compose.yml` 
```yml
REGISTRY_AUTH: htpasswd
REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM: Registry
REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH: /auth/htpasswd
```

Save the file and start the container. Whenever I run a new container for the first time I like to run it without the `-d` flag just so I can see what's happening and then once everything is working how I want it to I just stop the container and re-run it with the flag. So start the container

```shell
docker compose up
```

Note: Docker will automatically try to use HTTPS for connecting to the registry, but since all of this is staying on the local network I'm not going to bother with that which means we have to make a change to the server's Docker config.

If you set up HTTPS you can skip the following step.

Still on the Build LXC:
#### Stop the Docker container
```shell
docker compose down
```

#### Open the `daemon.json` file
```shell
nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

#### Add the following
```json
{
  "insecure-registries": ["<build-server-tailscale-ip>:5000"], // Add this line
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
  },
...rest of the config
}
```

#### Save the file and restart Docker
```shell
systemctl restart docker
```

Open a terminal on the __Coolify LXC__ and make sure you're able to connect
```shell
ping <build-server-tailscale-ip> -p 5000
```

If the ping fails, double check your Tailscale ACL file and/or the UFW rules on the __Coolify LXC__

#### Once you're able to connect, log in to the Docker registry
```shell
docker login <build-server-tailscale-ip>:5000
```

#### Enter the username/password you created earlier
```shell
Login Succeeded
```

#### Now SSH in to the build server and log in again
```shell
ssh root@<build-server-tailscale-ip>
```

```shell
docker login <build-server-tailscale-ip>:5000
```

You will probably need to edit the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file on the build server __and__ the VPS. Just repeat the steps above for each server.

> Note: I'm not sure why this file needs to be edited on all the servers, but when I remove it my builds fail ðŸ¤·

Make sure to run `systemctl restart docker` after each change to `daemon.json`

## Coolify LXC
Connect to the Coolify LXC and make sure you can SSH to the Build LXC
```shell
ssh root@<build-lxc-tailscale-ip>
```

If everything's good, go back in the Coolify dashboard and set up the build server

## Coolify dashboard

- Click the __Servers__ tab on the left menu
- Click the __+ Add__ button at the top
- Give the build server a name: __Build LXC__ or whatever you want
- Put in the __Tailnet IP Address__ for the Build LXC
- Keep the Private Key set to `localhost's key`
- Check the box that says __Use it as a build server?__
- Click __Continue__

Once you click the __Verify__ button it should start to install a bunch of Docker stuff. Let that finish and we'll try to build something!

If you followed the [last post](20250127-deploy-to-vps-from-coolify-on-proxmox-lxc) and still have the blog template you can select that, otherwise add a new project.

Check the box that says __Use a Build Server?__

In the __Docker Image__ textfield add
```text
<build-server-tailscale-ip>:5000/<app-name>
```

Make sure your __Build LXC__ docker compose is running if you stopped it earlier.

#### On the Build LXC
```shell
cd ~/registry-data
```

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Save your settings, click the __Deploy__ or __Redeploy__ button at the top and watch you build-server CPU dance

If everything worked you should have a successful build and all the hard work was offloaded to another LXC. This lets us keep our Coolify LXC nice and lean.

Now let's set up our UFW rules on the Build LXC and call it a day

## Build LXC

#### Install UFW
```shell
apt install ufw
```

#### Disable everything by default
```shell
ufw default deny incoming
```
```shell
ufw default deny outgoing
```

HTTPS and DNS are required to pull packages from the internet

#### Allow HTTPS
```shell
ufw allow in on 443
```
```shell
ufw allow out on 443
```

#### Allow out on HTTP
```shell
ufw allow out on 80/tcp
```

#### Allow DNS
```shell
ufw allow out on 53
```

#### Allow Tailscale
```shell
ufw allow in on tailscale0
```

```shell
ufw allow out on tailscale0
```


#### Stop and disable SSH
```shell
systemctl stop ssh
```
```shell
systemctl disable ssh
```
```shell
systemctl stop ssh.socket
```
```shell
systemctl disable ssh.socket
```

And there you have it! Coolify running locally on a Proxmox LXC with a local build server/Docker registry and everything communicates securley over an end-to-end encrypted tunnel thanks to Tailscale.
