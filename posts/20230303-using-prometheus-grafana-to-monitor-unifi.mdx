Now that I've got Prometheus and Grafana all set up to pull in metrics from Proxmox, I figured it might be cool to pull in all the data from the UniFi gear too.

These instructions assume you already have Prometheus and Grafana set up and running.  If not, you can read about that setup [here](/blog/20230302-prometheus-and-grafana-on-proxmox).

I'm going to set up the UniFi Poller on the same LXC container I'm running prometheus-pve-exporter on. So this container will just be the one that pulls in all the data from different places. Once that's set up I'll configure my Prometheus container to pull in the new UniFi stuff and Grafana is already set up so it should just be ready to go.

> Before starting,  create a new user in the UniFiOS and give it the View Only role.

### Setup UniFi Poller

Log in to the container Prometheus will pull from

#### Download and install UniFi Poller

```shell 
curl -s https://golift.io/repo.sh | sudo bash -s - unpoller
```

#### Edit the config file

```shell 
nano /etc/unpoller/up.conf
```

Set `disable = true` in the InfluxDB section

Change the `url` in the `[unifi]` section to the IP address of UniFiOS `192.168.X.X` and remove the colon and port

Change the `user` to the view-only user that you created earlier

Save and exit

### Prometheus config

#### Log in to the Prometheus container and edit the config file

```shell 
nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

After the last entry in `scrape_configs` add:
```toml
  - job_name: 'unifi'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["192.168.X.X:9130"] # The IP address of the container running UniPoll
```

Restart Prometheus

```shell 
systemctl restart prometheus
```

### Grafana

#### Install Grafana plugins
Log in to the container running Grafana and install the plugins needed

```shell 
grafana-cli plugins install grafana-clock-panel
```

```shell 
grafana-cli plugins install natel-discrete-panel
``` 

```shell 
grafana-cli plugins install grafana-piechart-panel
```

Restart Grafana

```shell 
systemctl restart grafana-server.service
```

#### Add UniFi dashboards to Grafana

- Open up Grafana in the browser
- Click the Dashboards option from the left menu and select "+ Import"
- In the textfield labeled "Import via grafana.com"
- Enter in any of the UniPoller Prometheus dashboards listed below

I mainly just look at the Clients one, but it's nice to have the Sites and Client DPI ones too sometimes.
