This site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, but I have another repo on the same Gitlab account that I wanted to put on a subdomain of pywkt.com. Since Cloudflare is already managing my DNS for the site, I assumed I would just add a CNAME record for pywkt.com that pointed to the `<repo>.pages.dev` URL that Cloudflare gives me when I host a repo on Pages. This is the correct idea, but I just went about it the wrong way.

---

The following instructions assume you already have a domain in your Cloudflare account. You don't have to purchase the domain through Cloudflare, but Cloudflare should be managing the DNS records for the domain you want to use.

- Log in to Cloudflare
- Click 'Pages' in the left hand menu
- Click the 'Create a project' button
- Select 'Connect to git'
- If your Git account isn't already connected, you will have to do that here. Once it's connected you'll see all the repos on that account.
- Select the repo you want to host on a subdomain
- When it asks for the domain you want to use, enter the domain _with_ the subdomain.

> __The root domain must already be connected to your Cloudflare account.__ For me, I entered something like: `whatever.pywkt.com`
- You'll have to either put in the build commands or have Cloudflare do it for you by choosing the type of site. For me it was a simple Create React App site so I just chose that.
- It'll also ask you to confirm that a CNAME record will be added to your domain's DNS. Confirm that and in a minute or two it should be good to go.

Simple.

The way I was originally trying to do it was through the domain's DNS options. I had my repo hosted already by Cloudflare at a `<repo>.pages.dev` URL from Cloudflare and I was trying to add a CNAME with that as the value, but when I would visit the subdomain on pywkt.com I kept getting Cloudflare timeout errors and couldn't figure out why. Turns out you do it from the start of setting up the repo. And that's that.

__Note:__ I may have the order of setting up build commands and confirming the DNS change mixed up. I just wrote this from memory, but will make a note to update that the next time I do this if it's backwards.
