Immich is probably the best self hosted and local way to manage, store and view your photos. I've been using it for quite a while now to backup photos from my phone, but in the past I had the NUC doing all the heavy-lifting. In this guide I'm going to pass that off to a better equipped machine and also pass through Quicksync for transcoding videos. I'm also going to set up a dataset in TrueNAS to store all the photos. And of course I'll be doing all of this in Proxmox.


---

### Ubuntu Server Setup

Normally I would prefer to use an LXC instead of a full VM, but Immich suggests using Docker and I don't feel like
setting up each service one by one, so that means I'll be doing this in a VM. I really don't like running Docker in an LXC.



Create a new VM in Proxmox, I'm using Ubuntu 22.04, 4 cores, 4GB of ram and 24GB HDD.

Once that's up and running go through the install process. When it asks if you want any packages pre installed, don't select any, just skip through.

Now you should be logged in and in the terminal.

Update the system

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

The next two steps are optional, but I'll be using Vim as my text editor and Zsh as my shell.
Install some quality-of-life packages

```shell
sudo apt install neovim zsh
```

Install oh-my-zsh

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

---

### Docker

Install Docker Stuff
```shell
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

Add GPG key
```shell
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Add Docker repo to apt
```shell
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Update
```shell
sudo apt update
```

Check to see that it's ready to go. If you see something like (Installed), you're good to go.
```shell
apt-cache policy docker-ce
```

Install
```shell
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

Check
```shell
sudo systemctl status docker
```

You should see the docker version.

---

### Docker Compose

Docker is cool, but Docker Compose is a better way of using it. Let's get that going now.

Create a directory for Docker Stuff
```shell
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
```

Install Docker Compose
```shell
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.3.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

Set permissions
```shell
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

Check version
```shell
sudo docker compose version
```

You should now see the Docker Compose version. If you've used Docker Compose before and you're used to the command being `docker-compose`, just know that they've updated it and the new command is now `docker compose`. Everything else should be the same, but there's just no hyphen (-) anymore.

---

This is where we start to deviate on our own path. My Immich server is going to be storing all the photos on my TrueNAS server, so we need to set up a dataset to hold everything and then link it up with our VM.

---

### TrueNAS

Create a dataset in TrueNAS and set up the permissions as you wish. When developing I tend to set read/write for everyone and only allow specific IP addresses in the NFS rules, but it's up to you.

Set up an NFS share for the dataset you just created and put in the IP address of your Immich VM in the allow list. Or you can just put you local subnet and allow all devices on your network, whatever works for you.

---

Back on the Immich VM.

### NFS

Install nfs-common
```shell
sudo apt install nfs-common
```

Make shared directory for images. I like to keep all my external/network shares in the `/mnt` folder.
```shell
sudo mkdir /mnt/immich-nas
```

Obviously replace the next line with the IP address/path of you TrueNAS dataset.
```shell
sudo mount 192.168.X.X:/mnt/<pool>/<dataset> /mnt/immich-nas
```

Check that it mounted
```shell
df -h
```

In the Filesystem column you should see the IP address of the NAS and the path of the dataset. The Mounted On column should have `/mnt/immich-nas`

Set the Immich server to mount this folder when it boots up
```shell
sudo nvim /etc/fstab
```

Add to the bottom of the file
```shell
192.168.X.X:/mnt/<pool>/<dataset> /mnt/immich-v2 nfs auto,nofail,noatime,nolock,intr,tcp,actimeo=1800 0 0
```

---

### Immich

Now that we're all set up it's finally time to install Immich.

Create a directory for the Docker files
```shell
mkdir ~/immich-app
```

Navigate to the new directory
```shell
cd ~/immich-app
```

Download the Docker Compose file
```shell
wget https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml
```

Download the .env file
```shell
wget -O .env https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/example.env
```

Download the hardware acceleration file (optional)
```shell
wget https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/hwaccel.yml
```

Edit the .env file
- Change `UPLOAD_LOCATION` value to `/mnt/immich-nas`
- Update `DB_PASSWORD` to a random string

---

### Quicksync

Since my Proxmox server is an Intel NUC with Quicksync, I'm going to pass that through to the VM so Immich can use it to transcode. If you aren't going to use Quicksync or don't have it available you can skip this part.

Install some hardware packages
```shell
sudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-22.04
```

Download/install the Intel Compute-Runtime stuff
Follow the steps on this page.
```shell
https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases
```

Log in to the Proxmox web ui and add the Intel driver to the VM
- Select the VM
- Go to the Hardware tab
- Click Add > PCI
- Select the Intel graphics driver option
- Stop and restart VM
- SSH back in

Once you're back in the VM, type
`ls -l /dev/dri`

You should see something like `renderD128` listed now.

Go in to the Immich folder with the config files
```shell
cd ~/immich-app
```

Edit the `hwaccel` file
```shell
nvim hwaccel.yml
```

Uncomment the Intel lines in `hwaccel.yml` to pass the folder to the container.
```yml
services:  
 hwaccel:  
   devices:  
     - /dev/dri:/dev/dri  # If using Intel QuickSync or VAAPI
```

Enable the `hwaccel` file in the docker-compose file
```yml
immich-microservices:  
   container_name: immich_microservices  
   image: ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-server:${IMMICH_VERSION:-release}  
   extends:  
     file: hwaccel.yml  
     service: hwaccel  
   command: [ "start.sh", "microservices" ]
```

---

At this point the Immich server should be up and running and you should be able to log in/create the admin account by going to
```shell
http://192.168.X.X:2283
```

### Remote Machine Learning

The Intel NUC is a pretty great server, but I'm planning on throwing a bunch of photos in here and I want to use Immich's facial recognition features. This can really bog down the NUC so I'm going to offload this work to another machine I have in the house that I mainly use for AI/ML/LLM stuff. The Following steps will be done on that computer, which is also running Ubuntu 22.04, but the full desktop version with an RTX 3060 Ti graphics card.

This computer didn't already have Docker installed so I followed the steps above for installing Docker/Docker Compose.

Create a folder for the Docker Compose file
```shell
mkdir -p ~/immich-ml && cd ~/immich-ml
```

Create the compose file
```shell
touch docker-compose.yml
```

Edit the file
```shell
nvim docker-compose.yml
```

Add the Following
```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  immich-machine-learning:
    container_name: immich_machine_learning
    image: ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-machine-learning:${IMMICH_VERSION:-release}
    volumes:
      - model-cache:/cache
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3003:3003

volumes:
  model-cache:
```
Save, exit and run the container
```shell
sudo docker compose up
```

You can also add the `-d` flag here, but since it's my first time running this I'm going to omit that so I can see the logs.

Open up the Immich web ui and log in as the administrator if you've already set that up. If not just go to `http://192.168.X.X:2283` and set up the admin account now.

Once logged in as the administrator, click the `Administration` button at the top right and go to `Settings > Machine Learning Settings`

In the URL textfield, put in the IP address of the machine running the `immich-machine-learning` container with the port `3003`.
```shell
http://192.168.X.X:3003
```

Save the settings.

In the past I've run in to issues where the Immich logs take up so much space it fills up the VM storage. So I like to set the Log Level to either Error or Fatal once I'm confident everything is working as it should.

And that's that. We've got Immich up and running with all the machine learning stuff offloaded to a computer that can handle it and Quicksync ready to transcode all those stupid hevc (or whatever) files from people with iPhones. Even if you're the only one using it, I still suggest making yourself a new account that isn't the admin account. Keep the admin account just for admin stuff.
